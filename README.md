### rathewolf
this is my new digital home [rathewolf.com](https://www.rathewolf.com)! (my can still be found at [rahilpatel.com](https://www.rahilpatel.com))

although this domain contains sites for my digital projects, this site (www...) merely serves as a site map to them.

it also contains a list of my digital works: my "portfolio". though, theere's a problem with this, as it doesn't contain all of the work i've done outside of this screen, which is, 90% of my works. [todo:] Perhaps a bio / history is needed.

digital projects 'n ideas including digital communities will be born here, on a sub-domain. If it grows, gets it's own name, it's own identity, it can be moved later. I reserved [willowolf.com](https://www.willowolf.com) and [wolfoftheway.com](https://www.wolfoftheway.com as potential places for older projects to move to and continue to live on.

### implementation
this repo contains the site for [(www.)rathewolf.com](https://www.rathewolf.com)

it is generated by GitHub Pages

### notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

todo:
change name in all writings  
the current image for this repo is kinda creepy...

[kind].willowolf, is the name of product 'n logo  
the way of [type], is the title  
a [type] anarchy, is the sub-title / description

notes:
this site should be controlled by me, so remember to keep the access restricted!

in the future, just change the `A records` back to my web host's servers, 'n build 'n deploy from my local computer (or web server?).

other:

example:  
hongry.willowolf  
the way of fighting games  
a fighting game anarchy  
a digital anarchy centered on fighting games  

willowolf vs wolf of the way

desert.willowolf vs fg.willowolf
  - desert creates a distinct type and image of a willowolf, whereas fg directly tells what the project is about
  - * i really don't like that OSs use this kind of naming convention. Mac OS's snow leapord or Ubuntu's gazelle has nothing to do with the product, except associate an image. Does desert willowolf do more? Or is it just a lame mascot?
  - fg.willowolf, the willowolf of fighting games, makes sense, similar to fighting games way of the wolf (fg.wayofthewolf). thus, desert willowolf does indeed feel like an extraneous mascot
  - can use domain redirects (or even aliases! ...but shouldn't)

fg.willowolf.com, redirects: desert, fight, fighting, fightinggames  
eg.willowolf.com, redirects: forest, experiment, experimental, experimentalgames  
ng.willowolf.com, redirects: mountain, nature, natural, naturesguardians, dao
