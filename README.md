### rathewolf
this is my new digital home [rathewolf.com](https://www.rathewolf.com)!

(my old site can still be spotted at [rahilpatel.com](https://www.rahilpatel.com))

although this domain contains sites for my digital projects, this site (www...) merely serves as a site map to them.

it also contains a list of my digital works: my "portfolio". though, theere's a problem with this, as it doesn't contain all of the work i've done outside of this screen, which is, 90% of my works. [todo:] Perhaps a bio / history is needed.

digital projects 'n ideas including digital communities will be born here, on a sub-domain. If it grows, gets it's own name, it's own identity, it can be moved later. I reserved [willowolf.com](https://www.willowolf.com) and [wolfoftheway.com](https://www.wolfoftheway.com) as potential places for older projects to move to and continue to live on.

new lines suck\
are backslashes at the end of the line really not a good idea?
