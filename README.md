welcome to...
# rathewolf
my new digital home!

my old site can still be spotted at www.rahilpatel.com

although this site contains a bunch of other web-sites for my digital projects, *this* site, www.rathewolf.com, merely serves as a site map to them.

it also contains a list of my digital works: my "portfolio". The problem with that though is that it doesn't contain the other 95% of my life, which was and is lived beyond this screen. [todo:] Perhaps a bio / history is needed.

www.rathewolf.com is reserved for *personal* digital works, such as my writings.

www.willowolf.com is reserved for public digital works intended for *the people*.

www.wolfoftheway.com is reserved... for the heck of it.

# notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

todo:  

other:
#### markdown notes
new lines suck\
are backslashes at the end of the line really not a good idea?
really just need to create my own mark-up language...  
ugh!

cut:
personal digital projects 'n ideas including digital communities will be born here, on a sub-domain. If it grows, gets it's own name, it's own identity, it can be moved later.
